&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * This class represents an observable object, or &quot;data&quot;
&nbsp; * in the model-view paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an
&nbsp; * object that the application wants to have observed.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer
&nbsp; * may be any object that implements interface {@code Observer}. After an
&nbsp; * observable instance changes, an application calling the
&nbsp; * {@code Observable}&#39;s {@code notifyObservers} method
&nbsp; * causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call
&nbsp; * to their {@code update} method.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified.
&nbsp; * The default implementation provided in the Observable class will
&nbsp; * notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest, but
&nbsp; * subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver
&nbsp; * notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their
&nbsp; * subclass follows this order, as they choose.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that this notification mechanism has nothing to do with threads
&nbsp; * and is completely separate from the {@code wait} and {@code notify}
&nbsp; * mechanism of class {@code Object}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is
&nbsp; * empty. Two observers are considered the same if and only if the
&nbsp; * {@code equals} method returns true for them.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see     #notifyObservers()
&nbsp; * @see     #notifyObservers(Event)
&nbsp; * @see     Observer
&nbsp; * @see     Observer#update(Observable, Event)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @param &lt;Event&gt; the enumeration of the event that this observable is emitting
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @implNote
&nbsp; * This class is a Generic Implementation of the deprecated {@link java.util.Observable}.
